# Plog

## Short Description

Plog is a simple project starter/template (or app) — a foundation you can build on or extend easily.

## Description

Plog provides a clean, minimal setup to start a web (or software) project. It includes basic structure and code, so you can focus directly on building features instead of initial boilerplate.  
Whether you want to use it as a learning base, a prototype foundation, or a full project scaffold — Plog gives you a ready-to-go starting point.

## Features / What It Offers

- Basic project structure  
- Easy to understand and customize  
- Minimal dependencies / setup required
